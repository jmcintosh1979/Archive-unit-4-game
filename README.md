UCF Coding Boot Camp - Week Four Homework Assignment (Crystals Collector Game)

## Overview
Create a fun and interactive game for web browsers while being dynamically update the HTML page with the jQuery library.


## Instructions
At the start of the game the computer will generate a random number between 19 - 120.  The user is then to use the "crystals" to increase their score to match the randomly computer generated number.   The "crystals" have random values assigned to them at the start of the game.

If the user is able to match the computer generated number, they will win the game and the "wins" will increase by 1.  If the user is not able to match the number, then they will lose the game and the "loses" will increase by 1.

Once the user has won/lost the game will reset and a new randomly created number will be generated, along with the crystal values being regenerated.
